* Created a Python software to predict crime types in San Francisco based on several factors like date, time, location, etc. based on past incidents.
* Used publicly provided dataset from DataSF containing 2 million+ total rows (https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/-Change-Notice-Police-Department-Incidents/tmnf-yvry/data)
* Generated predictions for categorizing several crime types (e.g. assault, robbery, etc.) at over a 60% success rate for individual districts in SF as well as the whole city of San Francisco.
* Used high level machine learning algorithms/libraries like XGBoost and One Hot Encoding.
* Used and configured AWS EC2 servers to process large dataset with created software.
